# Machine Learning Lifecycle

## Overview
The Machine Learning lifecycle defines the steps involved in building,
deploying, and maintaining an ML system in a real-world environment.

---

## Step 1: Problem Understanding
- Clearly define the business or technical problem
- Identify the objective and expected outcome

Example:
Predict house prices based on historical data.

---

## Step 2: Data Collection
- Gather data from databases, files, APIs, or external sources
- Ensure data quality and relevance

---

## Step 3: Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale numerical features
- Split data into training and testing sets

---

## Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze data distributions
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Detect outliers

---

## Step 5: Model Selection & Training
- Choose appropriate ML algorithms
- Train models using training data
- Compare multiple models if required

---

## Step 6: Model Evaluation
- Evaluate performance using metrics
- Validate model reliability

Common metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

---

## Step 7: Model Deployment
- Deploy the model as an API or service
- Integrate with applications

---

## Step 8: Monitoring & Maintenance
- Monitor model performance
- Handle data drift
- Retrain model when required

---

## Summary
Machine Learning is an iterative process that requires continuous
monitoring and improvement after deployment.
