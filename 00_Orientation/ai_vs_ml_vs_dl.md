# AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence is the broad concept of creating systems that can
perform tasks which normally require human intelligence.

Examples:
- Voice assistants
- Recommendation systems
- Face recognition
- Chatbots

AI can be rule-based or data-driven.

## Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data
instead of being explicitly programmed.

Key idea:
- Models improve performance by learning from data

Examples:
- Spam email detection
- House price prediction
- Fraud detection

---

## Deep Learning (DL)
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks
with multiple layers to learn complex patterns.

Key idea:
- Automatically learns features from large datasets

Examples:
- Image recognition
- Speech-to-text
- Autonomous driving

## Relationship Between AI, ML, and DL
- AI is the overall field
- ML is a method used to achieve AI
- DL is a specialized approach within ML

AI ⟶ Machine Learning ⟶ Deep Learning

---

## When to Use What
- Use **AI** for rule-based or intelligent systems
- Use **ML** when patterns can be learned from data
- Use **DL** when large data and complex patterns are involved

---

## Summary
- AI is the goal
- ML is the approach
- DL is the advanced technique
