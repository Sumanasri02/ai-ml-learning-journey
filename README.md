# AI/ML Learning Journey

A structured, end-to-end repository documenting the fundamentals and advanced concepts of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, developed with an **industry-oriented and production-ready mindset**.

This repository follows professional engineering practices and is designed to reflect how AI/ML systems are **learned, built, evaluated, and deployed in real-world environments**.

---

## Objective

The primary objective of this repository is to:

- Build a **strong foundation** in AI/ML concepts
- Apply **industry-standard workflows** and best practices
- Maintain a **clean, reproducible, and scalable structure**
- Serve as a **reference for interns and early-career engineers**
- Demonstrate **professional learning habits** during internship and beyond

---

## Repository Scope

This repository covers the complete AI/ML lifecycle, including:

- Mathematical foundations
- Python and data handling
- Exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Feature engineering
- Advanced machine learning techniques
- MLOps fundamentals
- Deep learning basics
- End-to-end projects

## Learning Approach

Each module in this repository follows a consistent structure:

- Concept overview (concise and practical)
- Hands-on implementation
- Clear observations and outcomes
- Reproducible code
- Professional documentation

This approach mirrors **industry workflows** rather than academic note-taking.

---

## Technologies & Tools

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- MLflow
- DVC
- FastAPI (deployment basics)
- Git & GitHub (version control)

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Modules should be followed sequentially
- Each folder contains its own documentation
- Code is written with clarity, readability, and reusability in mind
- Commits follow clean and meaningful commit messages

---

## Professional Practices Followed
