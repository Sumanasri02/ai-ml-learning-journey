# Math Foundations for Machine Learning

## Overview
This module covers the essential mathematical concepts required
to understand and implement Machine Learning algorithms.

These concepts provide the **intuition behind models**, rather than
heavy formal proofs, making it suitable for practical AI/ML work.

---

## Objectives
- Build a strong foundation in Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability, and Gradients
- Learn to implement small examples in Python
- Understand concepts for ML model interpretation

---

## Topics Covered
1. Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices)
2. Statistics (mean, variance, correlation)
3. Probability basics
4. Gradient intuition (no heavy calculus)

---

## Outcomes
After completing this module, learners will:
- Understand the math behind ML algorithms
- Be able to implement small calculations in Python
- Be confident to move into ML algorithms with intuition
